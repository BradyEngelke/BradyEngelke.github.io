		<p>Welcome! I constructed this page to showcase the art of data-storytelling through my own creative work as well as the books that have inspired me. Beginners in data scientist will get a sense. of how data science can be applied to answer interesting questions as well as links to the code to reproduce my work as well as links to articles that cover the technical details. The languages used for wrangling, modeling, and visualizing the data are python and R.</p>
		<p>A note about me, I obtained my Industrial Engineering degree from Iowa State University in December of 2018. I am now working towards a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the University of Minnesota - Carlson School of Management. Along the way, I have provided analytical support to the engineers of Walt Disney World, consulted the CMO of Principal Financial Group, and spent a summer as an entry-level consultant for Rockwell Automation.</p>
